## Assembly
Please do not attmept this if you are not comfortable with high voltage.  In many countries even attaching this thing to anying live requires a certified electrician.

3D print the enclosure and the lid, find stl files in the CAD folder.

## Configuration and integration
Initialize the device as normal in ESPHome, then paste the following configuration.  Mind the secrets.

## Ideas

I wanted to make the enclosure DIN rail mountable, so it has a goove in the bottom for the rail, but never got around to modeling the clip.
Another thing that's missing is cover for the terminals.  Is seems to be a common safety feature nowadays
